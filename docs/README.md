# Jung User Guide

Jung is a desktop app for managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the **benefits of a Graphical User Interface** (GUI). If you can type fast, Jung can get your task management done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Jung speaks Singlish and has a bit of an attitude - don't take it personally!
